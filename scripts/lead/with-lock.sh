# macOS has no flock(1), so the lock is an atomic `mkdir` of
# .worktrees/.state/locks/<name>.lock holding the holder's pid. A lock whose pid is dead
# (a crashed or killed lead) is broken by the next taker, under a short-lived breaker
# mutex so two waiters can't both break it. Waits forever by default, printing who holds
# it every 30 s. Exits with the command's status; 75 (EX_TEMPFAIL) if the lock wasn't got.
# Sets RTP_LOCK_<NAME>=1 for the command, so a script can re-enter itself under a lock.
#
# heavy-test is machine-wide: this is one Intel Mac, and a big batch here starves studio's
# suites and live app and mir-triage's runs (and theirs starve ours). So that one name is
# taken in studio's lock dir, the same lock studio's and mir-triage's leads take
# ($RTP_SHARED_LOCKS, default ../studio/.worktrees/.state/locks next to the main
# checkout), when that dir exists; without studio it falls back to this repo's own. Every
# other lock is ours. Run what it guards niced: `-- nice -n 15 <cmd>`.

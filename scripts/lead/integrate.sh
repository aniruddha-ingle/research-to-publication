#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The integration queue: merge one finished board node into the trunk, one lead at a time,
# under the `integrate` mutex. Run by the lead; nothing else moves the trunk.
#
#   scripts/lead/integrate.sh <node> [--dry-run] [--branch B] [--skip-t0]
#
# Steps (each prints a line; the first failure stops it):
#   1. the node is `review` or `ready` on the board and its branch exists; the main
#      checkout is on the trunk and clean (an uncommitted board edit is allowed: step 6
#      commits the board anyway);
#   2. the trunk is merged into the branch (in the branch's worktree; a conflict aborts
#      the merge and stops here: the node's owner resolves it);
#   3. T0 in the branch's worktree: `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . &&
#      uv run pytest -q` once the worktree has a pyproject.toml (until the package exists
#      they are skipped, saying so); plus unittest + bash -n when scripts/lead changed;
#   4. a full-gate node needs the peer-reviewer's PASS marker:
#      .worktrees/.state/pass/<node>, written by the lead, holding the evaluated SHA (the
#      branch tip at evaluation; any later commit must be a merge of the trunk);
#   5. `git merge --no-ff` into the trunk, from the main checkout;
#   6. board: state=merged (committed on the trunk, from the main checkout), the node's
#      claim and PASS marker are released;
#   7. prints what is left for the lead. Nothing is pushed here.
#
# --dry-run does 1, 3 and 4 as they are, tests 2 with `git merge-tree` (touches nothing)
# and only describes 5-7. Rehearse in a throwaway clone (tests/test_integrate.sh), never
# against the real trunk.
